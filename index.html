        <p>The Lion King is an upcoming American musical drama film directed and produced by Jon Favreau, with a screenplay written by Jeff Nathanson. It is a photorealistic computer-animated remake of the traditionally animated 1994 film of the same name. Plans for a remake of The Lion King were confirmed in September 2016 following the success of Disney's The Jungle Book, also directed by Favreau. The film stars the voices of Donald Glover, Seth Rogen, Chiwetel Ejiofor, Alfre Woodard, Billy Eichner, John Kani, John Oliver, Beyoncé Knowles-Carter, and James Earl Jones reprising his original role as Mufasa.</p>

            <p>The film was theatrically released in the United States on July 19, 2019. It has grossed over $1.6 billion worldwide, surpassing Frozen to become the highest-grossing animated film of all time. It is also the second-highest-grossing film of 2019, and the seventh-highest of all time. The film received mixed reviews from critics, with praise for its visual effects, music, and vocal performances (particularly Rogen and Eichner), but criticism for its lack of originality, and facial emotion on the characters.[6] The film received nominations for Best Animated Feature Film and Original Song categories at the 77th Golden Globe Awards[7] and 25th Critics' Choice Awards. It was also nominated at 73rd British Academy Film Awards and 92nd Academy Awards,[8] both for visual effects.</p>
